- convert raw log file to newer version

.P
.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.I atopconvert
can be used to convert the layout of a raw log file to a newer version.
The only mandatory argument is the name of the raw input file. When no
output file is specified on the command line, 
.I atopconvert
only shows the version of the input file.
When the name of an output file is specified, the input file will
be converted to the output file, or just copied when the input file
already has the required version.

The program
.I atopconvert
converts the input file (by default) to the format used by the
newest version of
.I atop
and writes to the output file. With the
.B -t
option, an alternative target version can be specified for the output file
(instead of the newest version) in the format
.I major.minor
(example: 2.3).
.br
After the conversion is finished, the output file can be read by
the newer version of
.I atop
or can even be extended by that
.I atop
version.
.SH NOTES
The raw input file should be at least of version 2.0!

Files can only be upgraded to higher version, but not downgraded.
